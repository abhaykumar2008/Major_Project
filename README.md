FEATURE-LEVEL RATING SYSTEM USING CUSTOMER REVIEWS AND  REVIEW VOTES 
 In the contemporary digital age, online platforms are inundated with an abundance of 
products and services, making it increasingly challenging for consumers to make 
informed decisions. Customer reviews serve as a pivotal source of information, offering 
insights into various aspects of a product or service. However, the sheer volume of 
reviews often overwhelms consumers, hindering their ability to extract relevant 
information efficiently. 
 
To address this issue, we propose a Feature-Level Rating System that leverages both 
customer reviews and review votes to provide granular insights into specific product 
features. Traditional rating systems typically offer an aggregate score based on overall 
satisfaction, overlooking the nuanced preferences of individual consumers. Our system 
aims to rectify this by dissecting reviews into distinct features and evaluating them 
separately.
